# 2020 Machine Learning Roadmap

![2020 machine learning roadmap overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavericktk/machine-learning-roadmap/master/2020-ml-roadmap-overview.png?)

A roadmap connecting many of the most important concepts in machine learning, how to learn them and what tools to use to perform them.

Namely:

1. ü§î **Machine Learning Problems** - what does a machine learning problem look like?
2. ‚ôªÔ∏è **Machine Learning Process** - once you‚Äôve found a problem, what steps might you take to solve it?
3. üõ† **Machine Learning Tools** - what should you use to build your solution?
4. üìò **Machine Learning Mathematics** - what exactly is happening under the hood of all the machine learning code you're writing?
5. üìö **Machines Learning Resources** - okay, this is cool, how can I learn all of this?

Many of the materials in this roadmap were inspired by [Daniel Formoso](https://github.com/dformoso)'s [machine learning mindmaps](https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap),so if you enjoyed this one, go and check out his. He also has a mindmap specifically for [deep learning](https://github.com/dformoso/deeplearning-mindmap) too.
